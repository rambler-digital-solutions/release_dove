# Release Dove
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gafrom/release_dove.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gafrom/release_dove)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/release_dove.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/release_dove)

Dead-simple widget allowing you to receive notifications about new releases of your application in a form of nice pop-up bar.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'release_dove'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install release_dove

Then drop a line to `routes.rb` to specify where you want your colleciton of releases:
```ruby
mount ReleaseDove::Application => '/releases'
```

Finally, plug in the front-end:
```javascript
TODO: include npm package 'release_dove'
```

## Usage

When running without front-end, _https://you_app.com/releases_ will return a collection of releases in `JSON` format from your `CHANGELOG.md` file, providing the latter is maintained in a [conventional way](http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/).
